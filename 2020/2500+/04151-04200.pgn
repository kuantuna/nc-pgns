{ Before the game I wasn't happy with how the pairings went. I had chosen the
worst possible number, and was forced to play two first rounds with Black.
Seeing, however, how this game went, I'm not so sure if my fortune was that
bad :) But ok, let's get back to the game. I think I know David quite well. We
are playing the same Wasko Katowice team in the Polish extraleague, besides we
have played some games against each other. He is a highly civil and
well-mannered person, but not in his chess games! In chess he is known for his
calculating skills, massive memory, deep opening preparation and enormous
creativity. However, in the last period of time it seems as if creativity is
playing tricks on him sometimes. David is an universal player, mainly choosing
between 1.e4 and 1.d4. Obviously I was prepared for both, but spent 10% of my
time on 1.e4 and 90% on 1.d4. Guess which move was played? } 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. h3 { Of course I checked at least 5
different options on move 6, but this one was quite probable. My games from
the Black side weren't very convincing, besides I got a difficult position in
one of our friendly blitz games at the closing ceremony of the Polish
extraleague. I wasn't naive enough to think he would forget about this game :) } 6... e6 7. g4 h6 { A novel set up for me, but I was going to play it on many
occasions. } 8. Bg2 Nc6 ( { They usually start with } 8... Be7 { I wonder if this
makes any difference. } ) 9. Be3 Be7 10. f4 Nd7 11. Nf3 $5 ( 11. O-O O-O 12. Nf3 $5 { is the most challenging continuation, and even though Black is okay with
accurate play, White has an attack in most of the cases, and it's very simple
to play for him. That's why I was going to take 11...Nxd4! However, David is
cutting this option once and for all. } ) 11... g5 $5 { I had this move in my
notes, but I spent 20 minutes on it as I couldn't remember whether it was a
good or bad continuation for Black. } ( 11... b5 { is the main move, and was even
played by my opponent: } 12. Ne2 Bb7 13. Ng3 Rc8 14. O-O O-O 15. Qd2 Qc7 $13 { with typical play for this variation 1/2 (37) Kulaots,K (2542)-Navara,D (2717)
Batumi 2019. } ) 12. Ne2 { Initially computers are very optimistic about White's
chances, but I think they overestimate the typical positions after g5 in
general. For humans such positions are very unclear, with many alternatives on
basically every turn, and that's why we all love the Sicilian :) } ( 12. Qe2 { is
similar to 12.Qd2 } ) ( 12. Qd2 gxf4 13. Bxf4 Nce5 14. O-O-O b5 $13 ) ( 12. f5 Nce5 13. Qe2 b5 $13 ) 12... gxf4 13. Bxf4 $6 { This looks a bit illogical with the
combination of the previous move } ( 13. Nxf4 Qa5+ ( 13... Nc5 14. O-O $1 { is the
strong idea, not fearing to give away the e4-pawn. } 14... Nxe4 15. Nd4 Nf6 16. Nxc6 bxc6 17. Qf3 $16 ) 14. c3 Nde5 15. O-O Nc4 16. Bc1 Qc5+ ( 16... Qb6+ 17. Nd4 $5 { is the extra alternative. } ) ( 16... Bd7 $5 $13 ) 17. Rf2 Ne3 18. Qe2 Nxg2 19. Kxg2 Bd7 20. Be3 Qa5 21. a4 { Engines give a very huge edge for White here,
which is kind of surprising cause his position looks very shaky without his
light-squared bishop. I guess White is very fast on the queenside to make up
for it. } ) 13... Nde5 $15 { the position is very bad for White in a practical
sense. He has to choose between many 'ugly' positions, and it's not so easy
for him to castle in a comfortable way. And every endgame is just better for
Black. } 14. Nxe5 ( 14. O-O h5 $1 { is huge for Black. } ) ( 14. Qd2 Nxf3+ 15. Bxf3 Bh4+ { Black has many good options here. } ( 15... Ne5 16. Bg2 Bh4+ 17. Bg3 Bg5 { is also good for Black. } ) 16. Bg3 e5 ( 16... Qf6 17. O-O Bxg3 18. Nxg3 Qxb2 19. e5 $13 ) 17. Rd1 h5 $132 ) 14... Nxe5 15. Ng3 $2 { This move surpised me. I
expected him to try to castle queenside. Obviously it can't be done easily,
without any consequences. } ( 15. Qd4 Qa5+ $5 ( 15... Ng6 ) 16. b4 ( 16. c3 Bd7 ) ( 16. Bd2 Bh4+ 17. Kd1 Qc7 $36 ) 16... Qc7 17. O-O Bd7 ) ( 15. Qd2 Bh4+ 16. Bg3 Bg5 ( 16... Qg5 $5 17. Qxd6 h5 18. Qd2 Qxd2+ 19. Kxd2 Bxg3 20. Nxg3 hxg4 21. hxg4 Rg8 { with a comfortable endgame is also an option. } ) 17. Bf4 { The most human. } ( 17. Qd4 h5 ) ( 17. Nf4 Qb6 ) ( 17. Qb4 a5 18. Qd4 Ra6 { This is obviously a highly
computerish line, but the idea is to meet } 19. O-O { with } 19... Qb6 $1 { and Black is
much better. } ) 17... Bxf4 18. Nxf4 Qh4+ 19. Qf2 Qxf2+ 20. Kxf2 Ke7 $15 { with a
dream endgame. } ) ( 15. O-O { is still no good because of } 15... h5 $1 ) 15... Qb6 $1 16. Bxe5 { Perhaps it was better to try something else, but either way Black is
clearly superior. } ( 16. Qe2 Bg5 $1 { is almost a killer according to the engine. } ( 16... Qxb2 17. O-O Bd7 { is also much better for Black. } ) 17. Bxg5 Qxb2 18. O-O hxg5 19. Qe3 Qb5 $19 { and there is no way Black can't finish his
development. } ) ( 16. Qd2 Nc4 17. Qd3 Qa5+ 18. Ke2 Nxb2 $17 ) 16... dxe5 $17 { Now
Black is just winning positionally, and White still can't castle. } 17. Qf3 Bg5 ( 17... Qa5+ 18. c3 Bd7 19. O-O Rf8 $17 { is much stronger according to the
engine, but the move played in the game is also not easy to cope with, and I'm
still not allowing him to castle. Besides going for the endgame can't be a bad
idea, can it? } ) 18. h4 Qe3+ 19. Qxe3 Bxe3 20. Ke2 $6 { Paradoxically this is
the losing mistake. The centre looks as stable as never, but White's king is
soon going to become a target! The last chance was } ( 20. Rh3 Ke7 ( 20... Bb6 $1 { is far simpler, aiming to play Bd8 and keep White's rook tied to the h4-pawn.
But I'm not sure I would have noticed it. } 21. Nh5 Bd8 22. O-O-O Rg8 23. Bf3 Bd7 $17 { and White is agonizing. } ) 21. Nh5 Ba7 22. Rf3 Rg8 23. Bh3 Rg6 24. O-O-O { It's still bad for White, but at least now he has a clear target on f7,
he can also try to establish his knight on f6. } 24... Bd7 25. Rxd7+ ( 25. Rdf1 Be8 ) 25... Kxd7 26. Rxf7+ Ke8 $1 { Very unnatural yet very strong. } ( 26... Kc6 27. Nf6 Be3+ 28. Kd1 Rd8+ 29. Ke2 Bc1 30. g5 { is suddenly quite complicated: } 30... hxg5 31. h5 Rh6 32. Bxe6 $132 ) 27. Rxb7 Be3+ 28. Kd1 Ra7 $17 ) 20... Ba7 21. Rad1 Bd7 22. Kf3 Ke7 $19 { Black is soon going to make threats on both sides, and White
will get overextended } 23. Rh2 Rhg8 24. Bh3 Ba4 { Creating some targets on the
queenside. } 25. Rhd2 ( 25. b3 Bc6 { and the new wave will come! } ) 25... Rac8 26. Bf1 Rg6 $1 { Planning either ...Rf6+ or ...Rcg8 with a potential ...f5. } 27. Nh5 Bd4 28. Bd3 Rcg8 29.

easy-looking win, and one more example of the saying that it never rains but
it pours! } 0-1

{ At the opening ceremony, I was surprised to find out that 'Prague Masters'
was a category 19 event, only one category short of the traditional Tata
Masters tournament. It's rare to see closed tournaments for 2700-2740 rating,
so I hope this fantastic initiative continues for many years! } 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Bd2 b6 6. Nf3 Bb7 7. Bd3 d5 8. cxd5 exd5 9. Rc1 Re8 { Blitzed out instantly. On the other hand I was spending time on each move 
(don't ask why!). } ( 9... Be7 { followed by ...c5 and the immediate 9...a6 with
the idea of î Pd6 are more popular. } ) 10. Nb5 { A novelty. I didn't fancy the
lines after 10.0-0 Bf8. In such lines if White doesn't know what he is doing,
it can get messy. } ( 10. O-O Bf8 11. Ne5 c5 12. f4 Nc6 13. Nxd5 Qxd5 14. Bc4 Qxg2+ $5 15. Kxg2 Nxe5+ 16. Kg1 Nxc4 17. Rxc4 Ba6 18. Rc1 Bxf1 19. Qxf1 Rad8 $132 { 0-1 (142) Bluebaum,M (2644)-Karjakin,S (2754) Moscow 2019 } ) 10... Nc6 { It seems strange to play î ..c6 which hinders the pawn advance c5. The point
is to exchange the b4 î P in a way which will help Black to achieve
counterplay or if White declines, then to keep the bishop. } ( { The obvious
alternative is } 10... Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 c6 12. Nc3 { It doesn't seem much, but
White clearly has a typical edge for this line. Or in modern terms they would
say it's 0.10-0.20 :) } ) 11. O-O ( 11. Bxb4 Nxb4 12. Bb1 ( { The pawn is a taboo
obviously: } 12. Nxc7 $2 Nxd3+ 13. Qxd3 Rc8 $19 ) 12... c5 $1 { Compared to
exchange of the bishops on move 10, Black has more active pieces. } ) 11... Bf8 12. a3 $1 { Played after 18 minutes of thought. Usually it's stupid to be down
to 47 minutes after move 12, but on that day it worked out fine. The idea is
to expand on the î Bside. } ( 12. Ne5 { This looked like the most natural way to
proceed. For example } 12... Nxe5 ( { But suddenly I noticed that } 12... Rxe5 $1 { is
very powerful: } 13. dxe5 Nxe5 14. Be2 c5 { In fact, Black is even better. White
is uncoordinated and Black can just roll ahead with the pawns. } ) 13. dxe5 Rxe5 14. Nxc7 ( 14. Bc3 d4 $1 15. Bxd4 Rg5 $132 ) ( 14. Rxc7 Ba6 $132 ) 14... Rc8 15. Nb5 { leads to small advantage for White. He can blockade on d4 or play around
the IQP. } ) 12... a6 13. Nc3 Bd6 14. b4 { I started to blitz out my moves to
cover the time difference. } 14... Nb8 { The first think of the game for Sam. So far
he had used only 3 minutes. The main problem in Black's position is the knight
on c6. If he can reroute it, he should be fine. } ( 14... Ne7 { was the
alternative. } ) 15. Qb3 c6 $4 { A typical idea for White in such position is to
play a4-b5, which creates a bind on the î Bside. Sam didn't want to allow that,
but the downside is huge. White simply breaks through with e4, after which
Black is in real trouble. I feel he  missed that he can't play 16..î Be7 to
stop e4 } ( 15... Nbd7 16. b5 Qe7 17. a4 { would have been the normal
continuation. } ) 16. Qb1 { Good but not the best. } ( 16. e4 $1 dxe4 17. Ng5 Bxh2+ 18. Kh1 $1 ( 18. Kxh2 Qc7+ $1 { Black defends the f7 pawn } ) 18... Nd5 19. Bxe4 h6 20. Bh7+ Kf8 21. f4 $1 hxg5 22. fxg5 { and White's attack is irresistible } ) 16... Bc8 { Looks too slow to be good. } ( 16... Nbd7 { sacrificing the pawn
seemed like relatively the best defense. } 17. e4 dxe4 18. Nxe4 Nxe4 19. Bxe4 Nf6 20. Bxc6 Bxc6 21. Rxc6 Nd5 { White is obviously better, but Black can
resist. } ) ( 16... Qe7 { doesn't really stop e4: } 17. e4 $1 dxe4 18. Nxe4 Nxe4 19. Bxe4 $1 Qxe4 20. Rfe1 $18 ) 17. e4 dxe4 18. Nxe4 Nxe4 19. Bxe4 h6 20. Rfd1 $1 { Very precise! It looks like it's just a normal move, but it has a subtle point.
More often than not, such moves win the game! } ( { Initially it looked natural
for me to play } 20. Bc3 { with the idea to play î ..e5, but I struggled to see
a continuation after } 20... Be6 21. Ne5 Bd5 22. Bxd5 cxd5 { Black will play Ra7 next
and things don't seem so bad for him. } ) ( 20. Rfe1 Ra7 { Although White's
position looks really active, I didn't see a clear way to improve. } ) 20... Ra7 ( 20... Bg4 21. h3 Bxf3 22. Bxf3 Ra7 23. g3 $18 { Black can't develop the b8 î ..
ever :) } ) ( { The main point is after } 20... Be6 21. Ne5 Bd5 22. Bxd5 cxd5 { White has } 23. Nxf7 $1 Bxh2+ ( 23... Kxf7 24. Qf5+ $18 ) 24. Kxh2 Kxf7 25. Qf5+ Kg8 26. Bxh6 $1 $18 ) 21. Ne5 Rc7 22. h3 $1 { Another powerful move. I renew the
threat of î ..xc6 and don't give Black the time to regroup with î Pe6-d5.
After the last three precise moves, Black's position seems close to lost, as
he is deprived of any play. } ( 22. Nxc6 $2 Nxc6 23. Bxc6 Bxh2+ $1 24. Kxh2 Qd6+ $11 ) 22... Qh4 ( 22... Be6 23. Nxc6 ) 23. Re1 $1 Rce7 { This loses material, but
it was already inevitable. } 24. Bh7+ $1 { Energetic! Tactics always work in
good positions :) } 24... Kf8 25. Re4 Qf6 $2 { Loses immediately. } ( 25... Qh5 26. Bg6 $1 ( { Also good is } 26. Rf4 $5 Bxe5 27. dxe5 Qxe5 28. Re4 Qf6 29. Bc3 $40 ) ( 26. g4 Qxh3 27.

1. e4 { I had made two draws until this round, so I really wanted to push for
the win in this game. } 1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. d3 { This is of course a slower move than 6.Re1, but it's in order to prevent the
Marshall. } ( 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O { With my opponent being a big expert of the
Marshall, I thought this time I should avoid it. } ) 6... b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 $5 { These days, the c3 move in this position is surprise to people, mainly because
of the more fashionable 8.a3!? which I played in the first round of this
tournament against Ragger. But in the old days 8.c3 used to be the main line. } 8... O-O 9. h3 Na5 { Going for the Chigorin setup. Two rounds after this game,
Vitiugov played 9...h6!? against me. } 10. Bc2 c5 11. d4 { So now we have the
old Chigorin setup, but with one tempo down for White (normally in the
classical line his rook is on e1 already!) But I thought in these closed
positions the tempo wouldn't matter - and I was probably right! } 11... Qc7 12. d5 $1 { And now White should close the center because there is no time anymore for
the Nbd2/Re1/Nf1 manoeuvre. } ( 12. Nbd2 cxd4 13. cxd4 Nc6 ( 13... exd4 14. Nxd4 Re8 15. Re1 Bb7 { and this just a decent position for Black because the white
knight is still on d2 and not on g3! } ) ) 12... Nc4 $5 { Pentala was trying to
exploit that my knight wasn't already on d2, making ...Nc4 impossible for
Black here, but... } 13. b3 Nb6 14. a4 c4 $1 { Now we can see that Black cannot
really play the old 14...bxa4 15.bxa4 a5 plan because my knight is sitting on
b1 and can go to the b5 square via a3! } ( 14... bxa4 $2 15. bxa4 a5 16. Na3 Ba6 17. Nb5 $16 ) 15. axb5 axb5 $2 { Its really hard to believe that such a move can
be mistake. But if you go deeper into the postion you understand that Black
should not really care about the pawns, and he has some great square like c5
for his knight and can get excellent counterplay! } ( 15... cxb3 $1 16. Bd3 ( 16. Bxb3 $2 Nxe4 ) 16... Nfd7 $1 { Probably the move that Pentala missed during the
game. } 17. Qxb3 Nc5 18. Qc2 f5 $13 { with a very double-edged position! } ) 16. Rxa8 Nxa8 17. bxc4 bxc4 ( 17... Qxc4 { Of course now this looks really ugly for
Black. } 18. Ba3 Re8 19. Bd3 Qc7 20. Bxb5 $18 ) 18. Ba3 $1 { So here I found a
very nice setup for my pieces which you can see in the game! } 18... Nd7 { 19.Nxe5 was
the threat. } 19. Bb4 Nc5 20. Qe2 Nb6 21. Nbd2 { This was the setup that I had
in mind when I played 18.Ba3. } 21... f5 $1 { The right move. Otherwise Black will
slowly lose the battle on the queenside. } 22. Rd1 { The logic behind this move
is simple of course: after ...fxe4/Nxe4 the pawn on d5 will be well protected. } 22... g6 23. Qe3 $1 { Very nice move. } 23... f4 $2 { This move just really questions the
move 21...f5! The idea was to open up things on the kingside and fight for
some counterplay, but for some reason probably he thought he was just worse
after the exchanges in the center. But anyway Black had to go for it! } ( 23... fxe4 24. Nxe4 Nxe4 25. Bxe4 Nd7 $14 { with idea knight f6. White is still
better, but Black is fighting. } ) 24. Qe2 $16 { From here I thought I was just
winning because it's clear that White will win the battle on the queenside. } 24... Ba6 25. Ra1 Ra8 26. Qf1 $1 { Playing for the A file } 26... Qc8 ( { Of course I was not
scared of } 26... Nd3 { because the knight on d2 will be well blocking the pawn
on d3! } 27. Bxd3 cxd3 28. Ra5 Nc4 29. Nxc4 Qxc4 30. Qa1 $18 ) 27. Ra5 Ncd7 ( 27... Nb3 28. Ra3 { and Black has to either go back or exchange on d3 which
does not improve his position at all. } ) 28. Qa1 Bb5 29. Nb1 g5 30. Rxa8 Nxa8 ( 30... Qxa8 { The endgame is of course completley winning for White: } 31. Qxa8+ Nxa8 32. Na3 Ba6 33. Ba4 Nab6 34. Bb5 Bxb5 35. Nxb5 $18 ) 31. Qa7 { and the rest
is just a matter of time. Black's pieces are all very passive and he has lots
of weaknesses. } 31... Nc7 32. Na3 Ba6 33. Ba4 Nf6 34. Nxg5 Nfxd5 35. exd5 Bxg5 36. Bxd6 Nxd5 37. Bd7 $1 Qb7 38. Be6+ Kg7 39. Bxe5+ Bf6 40. Qd4 { A very strong
game from start to finish! } 1-0

wasn't able to come, and the organizers got a great chance to invite Alireza

it eventually! } 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. d3 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 { A side line, but there were several top games here recently,

{ This game was played under very specific circumstances. It was the last round
of the tournament, played one hour earlier than usual. My opponent had a great
tournament scoring +3 and it seemed to everyone that he was clearly going to
win the competition. However, in the 8th round something apocalyptic happened
to him, because he lost a-not-possible-to-lose game against David Navara.
Vidit was clearly winning before the time control, and later he had an endgame
with a plus pawn which was drawn. Not being able to settle for a draw, he
overpushed and lost. I on the other hand had a mediocre tournament, winning in
the 1st round a cool game against David Navara, but losing in round 7 a
traumatic game to Alireza Firouzja, where after 15 moves I was basically
busted with White.  I was happy though to play with White against Vidit in the
last round, because I have never had a chance to play an official game against
him (with White). Considering our history, and more importantly his game
against David, it felt as if I was going to win an easy game. Obviously such
thinking is hardly dangerous, and I had to keep my composure, not letting my
emotions take over } 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 ( { Here is the aforementioned

{ When I was asked to analyse my games from the Prague Masters 2020, it was a
rather easy choice for me! The only game where I played well and won was from
round 9. Unfortunately, I won against Navara David who had a small chance to
share the first place had he won against me. I, on the other hand, was on -1
and hoping to finish on 50% :)    It is always difficult for us to play
against each other. It is funny we prepared many openings together, and yet we
keep finding new variations to play! Usually it is David who suprises me with
opening choices. In this game I decided to play something unusual. } 1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 { This is the first suprise for David. I usually play the QGA usually
in rapid or blitz. To be honest, I am not a fan of this opening :) } 3. Nf3 ( { I prefer } 3. e4 { , on the other hand it is difficult to remember all the
details if White is not prepared! } ) 3... Nf6 ( 3... a6 { I was considering to
play this. I felt there is no risk for White here and at best Black can hope
for is a draw. } 4. e3 b5 5. a4 Bb7 6. b3 e6 7. bxc4 ( 7. axb5 axb5 8. Rxa8 Bxa8 9. bxc4 bxc4 10. Bxc4 Nf6 $11 ) 7... bxc4 8. Bxc4 Nf6 9. O-O c5 10. Nbd2 { I
like White's chances here. Some correspondence games ended in a draw. } ) 4. e3 Bg4 { Objectively I think this move is dubious. However, it was the last round,
and I felt this surprise would give me chances. } 5. Bxc4 ( 5. h3 { White can
include h3-Bh5 if he wants, we will reach similar position to the game. } 5... Bh5 6. Bxc4 e6 ) 5... e6 6. Nc3 { White has a solid approach with Nbd2, b3 and Bb2 when
he should be slightly better I feel. David goes for the direct approach. } ( 6. Qb3 Bxf3 7. gxf3 c5 8. Qxb7 Nbd7 9. Nc3 cxd4 10. exd4 Bd6 $13 { Black has
sufficient counter chances for the pawn. I doubt any White player will take
this way. } ) 6... Nbd7 7. O-O Be7 8. e4 ( 8. h3 { I feel this is right way to
start as ...Bxf3 is no longer an option for Black here. } 8... Bh5 9. e4 O-O 10. Bb3 $14 { Avoiding any tricks with ...Bxf3 followed by ...Nb6. White stands better
here. } ) 8... O-O 9. e5 { By this time David was spending lot of time on every
move. I felt he was not feeling comfortable with the position. I do not like
the e5 move simply because if Black manages to regroup, the d4 pawn is a big
weakness and a black knight can occupy the beautiful d5 square. } ( 9. h3 { Here
it is not as effective as one move earlier. } 9... Bxf3 10. Qxf3 c5 11. e5 Ne8 12. Be3 cxd4 13. Bxd4 Nb6 14. Qd3 Nxc4 15. Qxc4 Rc8 { White is symbolically better. } ) 9... Ne8 10. Be3 c6 { [%cal Ye8c7,Yc7d5,Yd7b6] } 11. h3 Bh5 { I had intended
this kind of position when I went for this variation. I felt Black's play is
easier than White's. To my surprise the engine still prefers White. I cannot
disobey the silicon monster :) } 12. g4 { I don't like this move. I don't see
any clear plan for White in terms of improving his pieces. If he cannot do
that, then g4 is a clear weakness. } ( 12. Bd3 Nb6 13. Ne4 Nd5 14. Ng3 Bxf3 15. Qxf3 Nxe3 16. fxe3 f5 $11 ) ( 12. Ne4 Nc7 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Bd3 Bxd3 15. Qxd3 Nd5 16.

him to handle such a position. } ) 16... Nbd5 17. Qd2 Qd7 18. Rac1 Rad8 19. Nxd5 Nxd5 20. Nc5 ( 20. g5 Nxe3 21. Qxe3 Qxd4 22. Bxe6+ Bf7 $17 ) 20... Bxc5 21. Rxc5 fxg4 22. hxg4 Be4 $1 { David missed this move and now his position is clearly
worse. The Be4 controls a lot of important squares. White's king suddenly
looks exposed. } 23. Qe1 Qf7 24. Bd2 Qg6 25. Qh4 Rd7 26. Qh5 Qxh5 27. gxh5 Nc7 $1 { I had this move in mind before. I felt Black is either gaining a pawn or
exchanging the light-squared bishop which is technically winning for him. } 28. Be3 Bd5 29. Bd1 { David is always tricky, so I decided to calculate until the

solid as possible and exchange the light-squared bishops. :) } ( 36... Rxb2 $19 { was simpler: } 37. Bd8 Nb5 38. e6 Nd6 39. e7 Rb1+ ) 37. Rc2 Be6 38. Rf2+ Ke8 39. Rg2 Bxc8 40. Rxg7 Nd5 ( 40...

to resign as Black is simply two pawns up with the king going to c4. I could
understand his desire to somehow survive as it was the last round and he still
had a chance to share the first place.   I want to thank the organisers at the
Novy Bor Chess Club for organising a high level event with an interesting
field. With each year, the organisation is learning and improving the
conditions. } 0-1
