1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Bf5 3. e3 e6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. c4 Bxb1 6. Qxb1 Bb4+ 7. Kd1 { At
first sight, it can look a bit scary with the king in the center. However,
White has two bishops and better control over the light squares. It also helps
that the center isn't fully open yet, and White can take his king to the
kingside with a couple of tempos. However, Black should be completely fine in
general. The usual plan for Black involves taking ..dxc4 and going ...c5 at a
favourable moment. } 7... Be7 ( 7... Bd6 { is probably the main move here, where I was
inspired by the following game by the world champion, played in the same venue
a couple of years earlier: } 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. e4 Be7 12. Bb5+ c6 13. e5 Qf4 14. Bd3 c5 15. dxc5 Nc6 16. Qc1 Qb4 17. a3 Qxc5 18. Ke2 Nd4+ 19. Nxd4 Qxd4 20. f4 O-O 21.

Carlsen-So, Wijk aan Zee 2018. A very strong game by Magnus! } ) 8. c5 { The main
idea is to close the center (with White's king being on d1). I felt that this
makes sense strategically and prevents a lot of black counterplay involved
with opening the center. } 8... Ne4 9. Qc2 O-O 10. Bd3 ( { I had considered } 10. h4 { with the intention to prevent g5 related counterplay, but moves like } 10... b6 { worried me. } ) ( 10. g4 { preparing Bd3 also caught my fancy for a moment,
however, it seemed a bit too much. } ) 10... Nc6 $5 { I completely underestimated
this option of my opponent. } ( 10... g5 11. Bg3 f5 12. Ne5 { seemed a natural
way for Black to play and the position looked interesting. After the game, a

initial intention, which seemed the most natural. However, now } 11... g5 12. Bg3 f5 { [%cal Gf5f4] seems stronger. Now f4 is a threat. } 13. Ne5 f4 ( 13... Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Bf6 { is also an option for Black, and I didn't think Black was worse at
all. } ) 14. Nxc6 bxc6 15. f3 ( 15. Bxe4 dxe4 16. Qxe4 Qd5 ) 15... fxg3 16. fxe4 Rf2 { seemed messy. } ) 11... dxe4 12. Qxe4 ( 12. Ne5 Nb4 13. Qxe4 g5 14. Bg3 f5 15. Qxb7 Rb8 16. Qxa7 f4 { looked very dangerous for White. } ) 12... Bxc5 13. Ke2 { While my opponent was thinking, possibilites starting with Ng5 already began
to evince my interest... } 13... Bd6 ( 13... Be7 14. Rhd1 { seemed like an unpleasant
pressure. } ) 14. Ng5 { It took me a really long time to convince myself to go
for this. } ( 14. Bg3 { was the safer alternative. } ) 14... g6 15. Bxd6 cxd6 { This
was the critical move in my calculation. White no longer has a safe exit.
Therefore, it was important to make sure with a resonable degree of confidence
that the attack works, or it can backfire completely. } ( 15... Qxd6 { is the
best move according to Stockfish, but during the game I didn't pay much
attention to this move. } 16. Qh4 h5 17. g4 $40 ( { And of course, White always
has the safe option to play } 17. Ne4 Qb4 18. Nf6+ Kg7 19. Nxh5+ $11 ) ) 16. Qh4 h5 17. g4 Qb6 ( 17... Ne7 { was another move I had considered, with the
intention to drive the queen away from the h-file. } 18. gxh5 ( 18. Rhg1 Qb6 19. gxh5 { also looked interesting to me. } ) 18... Nf5 19. Qg4 Qb6 { also looked
messy to me, but apparently } 20. Rhd1 Qxb2+ 21. Kf1 { is just better for White. } ) 18. gxh5 Qb5+ 19. Ke1 ( 19. Kf3 f6 20. Nxe6 Qf5+ 21. Nf4 g5 22. Qh3 Nxd4+ 23. exd4 Qxf4+ 24. Kg2 { was also leading to a good position for White, but I felt

position. The conversion from such points is also not to be taken for granted.

for White. } ) ( 42. Kg3 f4+ 43. exf4+ Nxf4 44. Nf7+ Kf6 45. Kxf4 Kxf7 { is also

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3 { I noticed that Anton had employed this
line in this very tournament a couple of rounds before. However, after losing
the penultimate round with Eljanov I was reluctant to open my laptop and went
for a long morning walk instead. Anton was also playing many other things so I
decided not to prepare anything at all. } 4... c5 { After some thought, I played
something that I haven't played before but had it prepared for a long time
already. } 5. d5 O-O 6. e4 b5 7. e5 Ne8 8. f4 exd5 9. cxd5 { Here somehow I went
totally blank. I could not remember how Black plays right at this moment, but
I did remember that Black goes ...c4 after White plays Nf3 and ...Qb6 after
White goes Be2. I also remembered a lot of lines which come later but didn't
figure out how to get there. As a result, the following happened... } 9... Bb7 $146 { About a hundred games reached this position, and no one ever played this. The
moment I played Bb7 Anton started to think and after some time curious Anish
came to our board and started making mischievous inquisitive faces. It was a
clear indication that I cooked up something new. This is also the moment my
memory started rebooting and I vividly remembered every single line that
starts with 9...d6 instead of 9...Bb7. So, I got myself probably into some
horrible position and now my best bet is to keep the poker face on and pretend
that it was all part of Anand files! I should, after all, take some advantage
of the newly published book on Team Anand :) This not only just worked in the
game which convinced Anton that I was in some deep preparation but also later
in the closing ceremony both Erwin and Anish told that they also felt it was
some sort of a deep preparation!! } ( 9... d6 10. Nf3 c4 11. a4 Nd7 12. Be2 Qb6 13. axb5 dxe5 14. fxe5 Nc7 { and long theory here which is what I was aiming
for. I am still baffled how I conjured the move Bb7 which basically never
happens in this line! } ) 10. Nf3 ( 10. d6 f6 { This didn't bother me as such.
White is far too advanced and might not be ready for the breaks yet. } ) ( 10. Bxb5 { Only while analysing for CBM now I am seeing that the computer says this
is the way to go for White. During the game, however, both players felt this
is not so great for White. } 10... Qa5 11. Be2 ( 11. a4 Nc7 12. Bd2 Bxd5 13. Nge2 a6 14. Bd3 Nc6 $132 ) 11... Nc7 12. Bd2 ( 12. d6 Bxg2 13. dxc7 Bxh1 14. cxb8=Q Raxb8 { It's a messy position and I don't think Black is worse here by any means. } ) 12... Nxd5 { I stopped here during the game thinking that Black has nice play.
I am just giving one of the top lines what the computer gives. In order to get
more clarity about this position, I think some players have to forget their
preparation too and accidentally land in this position. } 13. Bf3 Bxc3 14. bxc3 Qa6 15. Ne2 d6 16. Bc1 { I am not taking responsibility for any of these moves.
My calculation stopped long back. } 16... Nb6 17. Qxd6 N8d7 18. Bxb7 Qxb7 19. O-O { and White is apparently slightly better. } ) 10... c4 { Played instantly in order
to pretend that it is all part of the Anand files :) } 11. Be2 ( 11. d6 Nc6 12. Be2 Qb6 { transposes. } ) 11... Qb6 12. Bd2 $6 ( 12. d6 { I was mainly concerned
about this. } 12... Nc6 ( 12... f6 13. Bd2 ) 13. a3 Bxc3+ ( 13... Ba5 14. Bd2 Qc5 15. Qc1 Bb6 16. Nd1 { The machine thinks White is clearly better, but in a game I would
still feel it is messy. } ) 14. bxc3 Na5 { I left here during the game thinking
it is complicated and that turns out to be right. } 15. Rb1 Nb3 16. Rxb3 cxb3 17. Qxb3 g6 18. Qxb5 Ng7 19. Qxd7 Rfc8 { Very difficult to evaluate this
position. I will stick with engines. 0.00. Obvious, isn't it? } ) 12... Nc7 $36 { On the 9th move I forget my lines, and on move 12 I am significantly better! I
can bet that even if I played this game with my laptop on, I still could not
have achieved this since in that case, Anton would also know what to do as
White. } 13. d6 Ne6 14. f5 $6 ( 14. a3 { was probably the lesser evil but already
Black is taking over: } 14... Bxc3 15. bxc3 f6 ) 14... Nd4 15. f6 { If only White could
castle, then probably Black would have to resign but that is not happening in
reality. } 15... Re8 $1 { The most logical way. } 16. a3 { This move was a bit
unexpected and put me into very deep think. There were simply way too many
lucrative options available to chose from. } ( 16. Nxd4 Qxd4 17. Nxb5 Qh4+ 18. g3 Qe4 19. Rf1 Nc6 $19 ) 16... Ba5 { After about 36 min of thought I decided to
keep it as simple as possible. } ( 16... Bxd6 17. exd6 Nxe2 ( 17... Bxf3 18. gxf3 Nxf3+ 19. Kf1 { didn't work. } ) 18. Nxe2 Be4 $1 { I briefly saw this but was
looking for more clarity.Â } ) ( 16... Bc5 17. Bf4 Nbc6 ( 17... gxf6 18. Rf1 { It
is winning of course, but once again I didn't see a direct way thus was
reluctant to take gxf6. } ) 18. Nd5 { The point of including a3-Bc5 } 18... Nxe5 $1 { This is a move that I wanted to make and it cost me quite some time on the
clock. } 19. Nxb6 Nexf3+ 20. gxf3 axb6 $19 { It's funny that I actually saw
until here and felt Black should be doing fine despite having just one knight
and one pawn for the queen. The computer confirms it is actually winning for
Black! During the game, I somehow didn't want to put everything on one single
line with a queen sacrifice when I had multiple options in which I would win
for sure. } ) ( 16... Nxf3+ $1 { was even simpler than text: } 17. Bxf3 ( 17. gxf3 Ba5 ) 17... Rxe5+ 18. Kf1 Ba5 ) 17. fxg7 ( 17. Be3 Nc2+ $1 { Keeping it simple. } ( 17... Nxf3+ 18. Kf2 { and there were many ways to sac the queen but I didn't
see a mate. } ) 18. Qxc2 Qxe3 $17 ) ( 17. Nxd4 Qxd4 18. Nxb5 Qxe5 ( 18... Qh4+ 19. g3 Qe4 { is also good enough. } ) 19. Bxa5 Qxb5 20. Bc3 Qg5 $1 $19 { This was a
very important move to spot beforehand. Now White is collapsing. } ( 20... Bxg2 21. Rg1 Bf3 22. Rxg7+ Kh8 23. Rxf7 { [%cal Gf7f8] with the threat of Rf8 now it
is White who is winning. } ) 21. Rf1 Qxg2 22. Qd2 Bf3 $19 ) 17... Nxf3+ 18. Bxf3 Rxe5+ 19. Kf1 Na6 $1 { This way White is never getting Nd5/Ne4. } ( 19... Rf5 20. Qc2 ) ( 19... Nc6 20. Nd5 ) 20. Be1 ( 20. Bf4 Bxc3 $1 21. bxc3 Rf5 $19 ) 20... Bxc3 { At this point, we were a bit low on time so I decided to eliminate the deadly
potential piece of White. Now my king on g8 is super safe. It is not bughouse
chess, so after I take the last knight off there will be no knight check
coming on f6 and my king can use White's g7 pawn as its shield. } ( 20... Rae8 21. Bf2 Nc5 ) 21. Bf2 ( 21. Bxc3 Rf5 22. Qc2 Qc5 { wins } ) 21... Nc5 ( 21... Bxf3 22. Qxf3 Bd4 23. Qxa8+ Nb8 $17 { is a fantasy line that I briefly saw but then
asked myself why bother about this when I can win just by normal moves. } ) 22. bxc3 Rae8 23. h4 Bxf3 24. Qxf3 ( 24. gxf3 Qc6 $19 ) 24... Qxd6 25. h5 ( 25. Bg3 Nb3 { [%cal Gb3d2,Gb3a1] } ) 25... Nd3 { Everything wins around here but I liked
this one the most for the final move of this game. } 26. Bg3 Qxa3 $1 { was a
nice way to finish. } ( 26... Qxa3 $1 27. Rxa3 Re1+ 28. Bxe1 Rxe1# ) 0-1
