{ The 2020 edition of Wijk aan Zee hasn't been easy for me and after a slow
start of four draws I lost a painful game to Firouzja after commiting a few
mistakes that a player of my level shouldn't be committing. I played this game
a day after that and was hoping to finally get things going. } 1. e4 e5 { Once
before Vlad Kovalev surprised me with an obscure Sicilian, but this time he
decided to stick to his lifelong weapon. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 { Italian is a
frequent guest on the highest level and theory keeps growing in all sorts of
directions. I have played it a lot before, but hardly ever with the idea of
developing the bishop to g5 early on, which is what I did in this game. } 3... Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. Bg5 { A very risky, but highly interesting idea which has
gained in popularity a lot lately. White almost forces black to weaken his
kingside with h6-g5, but in return white ends up with a burried bishop on g3.
The victories in this line, be it by white or by black are often crushing. } 6... h6 7. Bh4 a6 8. Nbd2 Ba7 9. O-O O-O 10. a4 g5 11. Bg3 { This position has been
reached in quite a few high level games, with various move orders. Black has a
huge choice of options or setups, the most popular move here being Nh7
preparing h5. The move Vlad chose is also not new and has been played by
theoreticians such as Peter Leko, Wesley So and Hikaru Nakamura. } 11... Kg7 12. Re1 Nh7 { Following Van Forees J-Leko from 2016 and Anand-Nakamura from Tata blitz
2019. } 13. b4 { Following in footsteps of Vishy Anand. He is as massive an
authority on the opening theory as ever. } 13... h5 14. h3 h4 ( 14... g4 { is another
way to try and develop the kingside initiative. } ) 15. Bh2 g4 16. hxg4 Bxg4 17. b5 Ne7 18. d4 Ng6 { I don't know whether my opponent was aware that we are
still following Anand-Nakamura or if he was long improvising, but one way or
the other, it all took him a lot of time. Here Vishy played the natural Be2,
but after some further mutual inaccuracies got nowhere and had to settle for a
draw. I had prepared a more direct continuation, not fearing the potential
doubling of the f-pawns. } 19. bxa6 bxa6 20. Nf1 $5 { This was the new idea. Now
over the board I had expected Black to quickly play Ng5, which to me seemed
the most natural, but my opponent came up with a surprising, but a cool
looking alternative. } 20... exd4 ( 20... Ng5 21. Ne3 Bxf3 22. gxf3 Nh3+ 23. Kg2 Ngf4+ 24. Bxf4 Nxf4+ 25. Kh2 { is the position I had expected to get. Black has a
juicy square on f4, but with h4 pawn shielding the white king nicely, it is
White who has most of the trumps here, which is what the computer insists on.
These days, the computers are almost always right in such cases. } ) 21. cxd4 Bxf3 22. gxf3 $1 ( 22. Qxf3 { was a little bit tempting, to keep the kingside
pawn structure neutral, but I quickly realized that after } 22... Bxd4 23. Rad1 Be5 { Black has pretty easy play and is likely to get away here, thanks to all the
dark squares and for now an extra pawn. } ) 22... f5 $6 { This move frankly
shocked me, but I kind of liked the look of it after a while. The computer,
though, realizing that chess is not all about the pawn structure, but much
more about the king's safety and initiative is shouting that white has a
winning advantage now and in more than one way too. } 23. Ne3 { I had a lot of
time on the clock after blitzing out most of my opening moves, so I figured I
may use some of it to calculate some sort of a long variation. It wasn't
really needed. } ( 23. exf5 $1 { is sort of very clean, but one has to understand
chess on a very high level to realize that it is time to sacrifice the
beautiful pawn structure in the center to gradually switch to the attack on
the king. } 23... Rxf5 24. Kh1 { it doesn't help Black that even if he attacks f3 pawn
one more time, it is still not hanging in view of î Pd5 and so î ..e3 and î
 Rg1 are coming, when White's attack will quickly develop itself. } ) 23... fxe4 24. fxe4 Qg5+ 25. Kh1 Rxf2 26. Nf5+ $6 { I have to say I was quite mesmerized
by the forced line that ends with 31.î Bg1!. I didn't realize I had much
better alternatives at this point, but fortunately the continuation in the
game worked out perfectly too. } ( 26. Bg1 $5 { was an idea I simply didn't
consider, now one of the possible lines could be } 26... Rb2 27. Qc1 Rab8 28. Bb5 $1 Rb3 29. Qc2 Rxe3 30. Bxe3 Qg3 31. Bf1 { when White is up an exchange for the
pawn and does well. } ) ( 26. Ra2 $1 { first was even stronger, but then again it
is important to see the î Pg1 motive later on. } 26... Raf8 27. Rxf2 Rxf2 28. Bg1 $1 Rb2 { now there seem to be two ways to play, one going directly for the king
and another for positional domination. } 29. Qc1 ( 29. Rf1 Kh8 30. Ng4 Rd2 31. Qf3 Bxd4 32. Qf7 Ne7 33. Be6 { with a deadly mating attack. } 33... Bxg1 34. Qe8+ Ng8 35. Rxg1 $1 ) 29... Rb8 30. Nf5+ Kh8 31. Bh2 { and Black can trade into an
engame, but there despite being a pawn up for now, he is completely dominated
and lost. } ) 26... Kh8 27. Rg1 { From now it's all forced. } 27... Rxh2+ $1 28. Kxh2 Qf4+ 29. Kh3 Ng5+ 30. Rxg5 Qxg5 31. Qg1 $1 { I was too fascinated with the idea
of trading the queens in order to force a pretty checkmate and also I noticed
a nice motif after 31.î Bg1! î ..f4+ 32.î Nh2 î Bxg1 33.î Rxg1 d5 34.î Pxd5 î .
.xd5 35.exd5 î Rd8 and now 36.î Rg4! when Black can't ever capture on d5, also
not after 36...î Nh7 37.î Nh3!. However, upon reaching closer to the position
I realized that while the domination does work in some of the lines, in
reality Black also has many defensive resources in the endgame that I so
happily went for. } ( 31. Qf3 { has a pretty threat of î Rg1, but it is strongly
met with } 31... Bxd4 $1 32. Nxd4 Ne5 ) 31... Nf4+ ( 31... Qh5 { seemed insanely risky
and is simply losing after } 32. Qe3 { followed by î Rg1. } ) 32. Kh2 Qxg1+ 33. Rxg1 d5 $5 ( { My opponent didn't have much time, but while he spent the
remainder of it, I thought I found a draw for him. Fortunately it wasn't as
easy as I thought it was. } 33... Rb8 $5 34. Rg4 Rb2+ 35. Kg1 Ne2+ 36. Kf1 $1 { I hadn't considered this option, missing 37.î Ne1!. } ( 36. Bxe2 Rxe2 37. Rxh4+ Kg8 38. Ne7+ { and here I noticed the precise } 38... Kg7 $1 { point being that after } 39. Nc6 Bb6 40. a5 Rc2 $1 41. axb6 Rxc6 { I don't have any î Rh7/î Rh8+ things. } ) 36... Ng3+ 37. Ke1 $1 Nxf5 38. exf5 { here Black has to still show some
resourcefulness not to lose on the spot- } 38... d5 $1 39. Bxd5 Rb6 $1 40. Rxh4+ Kg7 { and the line continues, but while white keeps the extra pawn and winning
chances, objectively it should be within for Black. } ) 34. Bxd5 Nxd5 $1 ( 34... Rb8 { here looked quite shaky and indeed there is no easy save here, contrary
to what my opponent had suggested after the game- } 35. Bc4 Rb2+ 36. Kh1 { here
Vlad pointed out } 36... Nh5 { but missed that there is a pretty refutation- } 37. e5 $1 Ng3+ 38. Rxg3 $1 hxg3 39. e6 $1 { and White will win the rook for the passer. } ) 35. exd5 Re8 $2 { The natural 35...î Rd8 fails to the aforementioned 36.î Rg4!
idea, based on a fork. Instead, however Black could force a draw brutally here. } ( 35... Rg8 $1 { I thought trading rooks was incredibly dangerous for Black
and most likely losing, which is evidently what my opponent thought too, but

bothering his central configuration, but Black has a forced solution- } 38... Kf6 39. Kg4 Bxd4 $1 40. Nxd4 Ke5 { and it is not that hard once in this position, to
realize that Black is just in time to capture both remaining pawns. } ) 36. Kh3 $5 { It is logical to assume that if Black didn't trade the rooks on the
previous move, he isn't going to do it now and at the same time I wasn't sure
if the natural 36.î Rg4 doesn't allow Black a miraculous escape after he
activates his rook. } ( 36. Rg4 Re1 $1 { the computer defends very precisely, in
fact White wants to activate his king anyway, so there is no need to rush it
with check. } ( 36... Re2+ { is what I wasn't sure about. } 37. Kh3 Ra2 38. Kxh4 Rxa4 39. Kg5 { here White actually creates a mating net with the remaining
forces. } ) 37. a5 h3 $1 { This is just math. } 38. Kxh3 Ra1 39. Rh4+ Kg8 40. Ne7+ Kf7 41. Nc6 Rh1+ $1 { the point of h3! } 42. Kg3 Rxh4 43. Kxh4 Bxd4 { here it is
particularly miraculous that Black is saving it, but he does. } 44. Nxd4 Ke7 ) 36... Bb6 $2 { Black really had to trade rooks. } ( 36... Re4 $1 37. Rg4 Rxg4 38. Kxg4 Kg8 39. Kxh4 Kf7 40. Kg5 { here Black doesn't draw by the bishop sac on d4,
but he can still setup the final line of defense. } 40... Ke8 41. Kf4 Kd7 42. Ke4 c6 $1 { it is essential to push this quickly. When I was thinking about this
endgame during the game, I assumed Black wouldn't help white in creating the
passed pawn, but then white would actually win by means of endless knight
jumps provoking a5 and so on, although it is all not obvious even after all
that. } 43. dxc6+ Kxc6 44. Ne7+ Kd7 45. Ng6 Kd6 46. Ne5 Bb8 { and Black sets up
some sort of a defense, which it seems can not be broken. } ) 37. Kxh4 Rd8 38. Rg5 $5 { It was incredibly tempting to try and mate the Black king and it seems
it was possible to do so. The move I made keeps the position winning and is a
lot more prosaic. } ( 38. Kh5 $5 Bxd4 { was my issue and now I calculate a few
moves further- } 39. Rh1 Kg8 40. Kg6 Bc5 { I thought this was key. Here I didn't
find a mate, but I actually stopped looking just a tad too early. } 41. Rh7 Rxd5 42. Rxc7 $1 { and white mates after all. The position after Black sacs the
exchange is not a draw, by the way. } 42... Rxf5 43. Kxf5 Bb4 { Black king is cut off
very badly here, the easiest win would be- } 44. Kf6 a5 45. Rf7 Bc3+ 46. Kg6 { also possible is to bring the king to b5, with king cut off on the f-file it
is too far to come back in time to c8. } 46... Bb4 47. Rf5 { with a zugzwang. } ) 38... Kh7 { loses, but otherwise î Nh5-î Ng6 was a threat. Black's position seems
lost already. } 39. Rh5+ Kg6 40. Ne7+ Kf6 41. Nc6 { It was tempting to dominate
the bishop with the knight like that, but it was only after I saw that I win
by force that I had decided to go for this. Sometimes positions are too pretty
to be won, but this was fortunately not the case here. } 41... Re8 42. Re5 Rh8+ 43. Kg4 a5 ( 43... Bxd4 { is met with the intermezzo } 44. Re6+ ) 44. Rf5+ $1 { At
first I was tempted to try and push the Black king down to the 8th rank, but
after further searching I found a more forcing way to win. } 44... Kg6 { This loses on
the spot, but the only alternative lost by force too. } ( 44... Kg7 45. d6 $1 { As so often, you have to free the dominated opponent briefly, in order to
convert the positional advantage into some concrete gain. } 45... cxd6 46. Rb5 Bd8 { and here I intended the simple } 47. Nxd8 $5 Rxd8 48. Kf5 { with an easily won
rook endgame. } ) 45. Ne5+ Kg7 46. Rg5+ Kh7 47. Rh5+ Kg7 48. Rxh8 Kxh8 { with
Black king so far from the action the endgame is dead lost. } 49. Nc4 { the
quickest path to resignation. } 49... Kg7 50. Kf5 Kf7 51. d6 1-0

{ Firouzja had made a marked impression, at this point leading the tournament
with 5 rounds to go. It could be said that someone experienced should have
told Alireza to take it easy and aim for a draw, but that would ruin the
chance to gain experience and the young Iranian ( FIDE?) stays true to his
aggressive instincts and goes for it! } 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 { Aiming for a battle. } ( 4. O-O Nxe4 5. Re1 { would be going in the other
direction. } ) 4... d6 $5 { 4...Bc5 by far being the main-line these days, Magnus
chooses a solid line known to give White a moderate edge, but keeping all the
pieces on the board. } 5. c3 { In the World blitz he had played 5.c4, but here
he chooses the main line. } 5... a6 6. Ba4 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 Re8 9. Nbd2 Bf8 10. h3 b5 11. Bc2 { After a lot of typical "Spanish" moves, its worth noting the
bishop going to c2 instead of b3, as that would allow ...Na5 followed by ...c5. } 11... Bb7 12. d4 { Would Magnus now play 12...h6, then after 13.a4 a famous
position from the Kasparov-Karpov matches would arise by transposition, with
white having played d4 in 2 moves, but Bc2 instead of Bb3-c2. The line has
gone out of fashion, except for the detail that Firouzja brought it back to
people's attention by beating Kovalev with it in the first round! Magnus,
however, knows his classics, and that Karpov had exploited that White now has
no threat of Ng5 meaning ...h6 is unneccesary, and thus makes a more useful
move: } 12... g6 $5 { Quite interestingly Karpov in 2019 in the legends rapid
tournament deviated agianst Ljubojevic, and played 12...Nb8. Or maybe he
exactly remembered that he had lost against the same player with 12...g6 28
years earlier! } 13. a3 $6 { The move in itself is good enough, but the plan is
wrong. } ( 13. d5 Nb8 14. b3 c6 15. c4 Nbd7 16. a4 Qc7 { has been played numerous
times, and transposes into the game, with the exception that here it is White
to move! } ) 13... Nb8 14. d5 { [%emt 0:00:14] } ( 14. Nb3 $5 { [%cal Gb3a5] would
be an interesting move, threatening Na5. } 14... exd4 { is the typical reply, as now
e4 is hanging, but } 15. Bg5 $5 { renews the threat of Na5, and } 15... dxc3 $2 ( 15... h6 $1 { , however, is fine for Black. } ) 16. e5 $1 { wins a piece. } ) ( 14. b4 { would be more in line with 13.a3, when after } 14... Nbd7 15. Bb2 { we have a typical
Breyer position. } ) 14... c6 15. c4 Nbd7 16. a4 Qc7 $1 17. b3 { The
above-mentioned position, but with Black to move. Magnus uses the given extra
tempo to regroup. } 17... Rec8 $1 18. Ra2 bxc4 19. bxc4 a5 $1 20. Nf1 $2 { A logical
and typical move, but a mistake.The problem for White is that optically we
would tend to asses it as White being slightly better. After all, he has the
centre, and can regroup behind it. The game exemplifies why that is very far
from the truth, and thus } ( 20. Nb1 $1 { , strange as it looks, would be a much
better move, trying to land the knight on b5, and at least put up some
resistance to Black's plans. } ) 20... Ba6 $1 21. Ne3 Nc5 22. Nd2 cxd5 23. cxd5 Rab8 24. Ba3 Qd8 $5 { A good move, also for illustrative purposes, as Magnus
retreats his queen to the back rank but clears the c-line for his rook. } 25. Qf3 h5 $1 26. Raa1 Bh6 $1 { A beautiful geometrical motif, with Black's bishops
literally playing around White's centre. The a5 and h5 pawns provide excellent
cover, meaning the bishops becomes untouchable, and dominate till the end. } 27. Rab1 Rxb1 28. Rxb1 Kg7 $1 29. Nef1 h4 $1 { Black just keeps improving his
postion, as White can literally not do anything active without immediately
losing material. } 30. Ne3 Bf4 31. Nef1 Qc7 32. g3 $6 { Alireza loses patience,
an in order " to do something", just weakens his position. } ( 32. Ne3 { ,
staying loyal to the back and forth concept, could have led to this beautiful
line: } 32... Ncd7 33. Rc1 Qc3 34. Nb1 Qa1 $1 { when White is completely dominated and
loses material! } ) 32... hxg3 33. fxg3 Bh6 34. h4 Qd7 { Simplicity at its best,
eyeing the a4 pawn, which white really can do nothing about. } 35. Kg2 Nxa4 36. Bxa4 Qxa4 37. Bxd6 Qd4 $1 { The knight on d2 is hanging, there is a threat of
38...Ne8 as bxa3 Rc3 then wins a piece, etc. White position is collapsing. } 38. Qf2 ( 38. -- Ne8 39. Ba3 Rc3 ) 38... Qxf2+ 39. Kxf2 Bxf1 { And here Alireza,
being very short of time resigned, as 40.Nxf1 Nxe4+ loses the bishop on d6.
However, with 40.Kxf1 Bxd2 41 Bxe5 he could have prolonged the game somewhat.
Magnus was planning 41...Bc3 42.Rc1! Bxe5 43.Rxc8 Nxe4, and while the win will
take some moves, the result is not in doubt.  A great strategical game by
Magnus, outplaying his young opponent by positional means. One could even make
the statement that absolutely no tactical remedies were used by Black at all
in tis game, he only further and further strengthened his own position until
his opponent's camp collapsed! } ( 39... Bxf1 40. Kxf1 ( 40. Nxf1 Nxe4+ ) 40... Bxd2 41. Bxe5 Bc3 42. Rc1 $1 Bxe5 43. Rxc8 Nxe4 $19 ) 0-1

{ The game was played on 11th round, and after a free day which felt no fun at
all. Magnus had just overcome a drawing crisis and had scored 3/3 in the last
rounds. Still he was down to Caruana by half a point, so I assumed he would go
for an even higher winning streak. Furthermore the free day made me paranoic
about his opening preparation. After much thought I decided to stay loyal to
my 1.e4 and see what happens, without certainity though. } 1. e4 e5 { So after
