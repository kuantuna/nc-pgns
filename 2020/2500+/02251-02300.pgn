the vague } 26. Ne4 ( { while the following line leads to a semi-forced perpetual

adequate play in return for the queenside passers. } 27. Ne4 $1 ( 27. Nd5 { also
an option. } ) ) ( 25... Rce8 $5 { is another cunning idea, with unclear play - } 26. Qb2 Bg4 27. Ne5 Bxe5 28. dxe5 Qd4 { with equality is a likely scenario. } ) 26. Qe3 ( 26.

too, but it is probably not as straightforward as in the game. } ) 32... Bxf7 33. Rxf7 Re2 $1 { Played after some hesitation, but in fact it is strictly the only
move. Cutting the white king is essential. } ( 33... Rd8 { was what I was hoping

this order, but having made so many precise moves already, this one was no
longer too big a challenge. } 38. Rh7+ Kg8 39. Rxh5 Rb2 { From afar I calculated
till here and saw î Ra1 back, but already few moves into the line I realized
this was a dead draw, but there no longer was a sensible way to deviate. } 40. Rg5+ Kh8 41. Rh5+ Kg8 42. Rg5+ Kh8 43. Ra1 Rdd2 44. Rh5+ Kg7 45. Kh1 { White
has no way of improving this position. A peculiar draw, though given that both
black rooks enjoy the second rank, it isn't all too surprising. } 45... Rf2 46. g4 Kg6 47. Rg1 Rb8 48. Rh3 Kg5 49. Rhg3 Rbb2 50. Rh3 Rb8 51. Rh7 Kg6 52. Rh5 Rc8 53. Ra1 Rcc2 54. Ra6+ Kg7 55. Rg5+ 1/2-1/2

got very special attention recently when Ding used this against Grischuk in

the same as Black in 2019! } 9. Bxc6+ bxc6 10. dxe5 Ng4 11. Nxc4 Be6 { This
position is pretty much forced after White played 8.Nfd2. Black is a pawn down,

played this first in 2012 and it was Gelfand who used this in a classical game

simply take on d2 on the next move when White is forced to take back with his
c4 knight. } ( 12... h5 { was the move twice used by Alexander Mikhalevski and
